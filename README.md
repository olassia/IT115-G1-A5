# QR CODE GENERATOR 

Within this guide are the steps required to create your own QR Code Generator.  A QR, or “quick response” code, is capable of storing significant amounts of data for its size and a QR Code Generator is a simple application that takes a user’s text input and generates a corresponding QR Code. 

# REQUIREMENTS 
A computer with any operating system ( OSX, Windows, etc.)
A Text Editor for coding, such as Notepad++, Visual Studio Code 
A Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript 

# Getting Started 
Open your preferred Text editor, go to the top left and select “File” under File select “New File”.  A new file will be created but before saving it, create a new folder to contain all files pertaining to this project, name it “QR Project”.

Below is an image of what you should write into the new file, when you have copied the code in the image save the new file as “index.html” into your “QR Project” folder. Install the “Browser Preview” extension to view build as you proceed. *Notice line 9 - “defer” attribute will prevent the DOMCcontentLoaded event from firing until the script has loaded and finished evaluating.

Next create a new file and save as “style.css” this will stylize your application.  Reproduce the code in the two images below into the file.

After that create another file and name it “script.js” this will utilize Javascript to perform the user requested interaction.  Reproduce the code in the image below into the file.
